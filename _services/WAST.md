Application security has become a major concern in recent years. Hackers are using new techniques to gain access to sensitive data, disable applications and administer other malicious activities aimed at the software application. Until recently, application security was an afterthought; developers were typically focused on functionality and features, waiting to implement security at the end of development. Securze Web Application Security Testing approach to application security has proven to be disastrous; much vulnerability has gone undetected allowing applications to be attacked and damaged. And Securze can manage testing at all times, across your entire enterprise.
