Our cloud penetration testing services identify vulnerabilities in your AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud infrastructure and guide you on how to improve cloud security.

<b>AWS Penetration Testing</b>

AWS penetration testing helps you find cloud security gaps that create exposure and risk. It is a necessary component of security if your organization is migrating to AWS, developing applications in AWS, or pentesting annually for compliance.

During AWS penetration tests, Securze identifies vulnerabilities, credentials, and misconfigurations that allow our expert cloud pentesters to access restricted resources, elevate user privileges, and expose sensitive data. Testing also identifies exposure of internet-exposed management interfaces, S3 buckets exposed to the internet, and security gaps in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) configurations.

<b>Azure Penetration Testing</b>

Whether you are migrating to Azure, developing applications in Azure, or pentesting annually for compliance, Microsoft Azure penetration testing helps you ensure your cloud infrastructure is secure.

Securze identifies high impact vulnerabilities found in your Azure cloud services, including applications exposed to the internet. Our Azure pentesting also finds credentials, excessive privileges, and misconfigurations in Azure Active Directory that can lead to the compromise of your Azure infrastructure and enable an attacker to expose sensitive data, take over Azure resources, or pivot to attack your internal network.

<b>Google Cloud Platform Penetration Testing</b>

Google Cloud penetration testing helps organizations establish security as they migrate to Google Cloud, develop applications in GCP, or use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

During Google Cloud penetration tests, Securze tests for vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit. Our testing goes beyond automated scanning to manually exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations to identify security gaps in your Google Cloud attack surface.
