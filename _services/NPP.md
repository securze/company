The biggest challenge for any IT organization is to measure and prioritize information security vulnerabilities as they would be by an adversary practiced in cyber hacking tools and techniques. This requires a different perspective, tools and expertise than what traditional IT resources have on the team.

Infrastructure Penetration Testing services help you test your network security defences and meet compliance with government or industry regulations. A penetration test (also known as ethical hacking) determines how well your organization's security policies protect your assets by trying to gain access to your network and information assets in the same way a cyber attacker would.

We provide:

+ Periodic security assesment of your entire infrastructure
+ Periodic report of our assesment
+ On site pentest
+ Customised solutions
