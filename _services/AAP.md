Application security testing is a process that is performed with the intention of revealing flaws in security mechanisms and finding the vulnerabilities or weaknesses of software applications. Recent security breaches of systems, underscore the importance of ensuring that your security testing efforts are up to date.

The prime objective of security testing is to find out how vulnerable a system may be and to determine whether its data and resources are protected from potential intruders. 

Securze pentest approach goes beyond the test cases mentioned in the OWASP top 10 SANS, NIST frameworks. Securze helped customers for spotting the high business risk vulnerabilities such as authentication, authorization, and business logic vulnerabilities which may results in data breach. Enterprises and SME organizations used our application pentest service for improving posture without spending a million dollars.
