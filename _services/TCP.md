Undoubtedly, penetration testing plays quite a crucial role when it comes to protecting your organization and valuable assets from potential hackers. However, the benefits of Thick Client Penetration Testing Service are far beyond data and network security.

Thick client pentesting involves both local and server-side processing and often uses proprietary protocols for communication.
Simple automated assessment scanning is not sufficient and testing thick client applications requires a lot of patience and a methodical approach. Moreover, the process often requires specialized tools and custom testing setup.

Our thick client application assessments start with analyzing your thick client software and the server-side APIs it interacts with. This information, along with some other potential business risks, gives us an idea for testing your thick client software.

# Architecture of Thick Client

Two-Tier architecture:
<hr=20%>
In two-tier architecture, the thick client application implements a client-to-server communication. The application is installed on the client computer and, in order to work, will need to communicate with a database server. For example, imagine an HR application that was installed on the client computer and, in order to retrieve the employee's information, communicates directly with the HR database server.

Three-Tier architecture:
<hr=20%>
In three-tier architecture, the client communicates with an application server, which in turn talks to the database in a manner similar to a regular web application. The most common communication method in these applications may be carried out using HTTP/HTTPS.
Three-tier architecture has a security advantage over two-tier architecture, because it prevents the end-user from communicating directly with the database server.
